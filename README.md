### Data analysis using a variety of techniques in Python including LASSO regression, simple and slightly more complex multivariate regression, descriptive statistics and more.
All of the data used in the scripts can be found in the datasets folder. Most data was provided in graduate courses. Exceptions are noted as they arise.

#### Russian Troll Ads 
The `Russian Troll Ads` folder contains various analyses on Russian "Troll" Ads, using facebook and instagram data from graduate courses as well as data released by Congress and other sources. Topics include sentiment analysis using an API, and finding insights into click predictors with 'keras' neural net and `RandomForestRegressor`.

#### topic-modeling 
The `topic-modeling` folder contains scripts relating to topic modeling for a brand using a data set of clothing and shoe reviews on Amazon.com.

#### time-series
The `time-series` folder contains a jupyter notebook outlining my steps on creating multiple time series analysis of AT&T search trend on Google using multiple advertising spend data sets, gathered from Ad$pender.

#### data-visualization 
The `data-visualization` folder contains visualizations done on a MLB batting data set.

#### The following files use the `data` folder: 
##### Accessing Census Data with an API 
This is my first foray into using an API in Python. I used the Census Reporter API to gather data and perform basic analyses on it.

##### Basic Ad Analysis 
Basic analysis on digital advertising data.

##### Using LASSO Regression in Python to Predict Purchases from Demographic Information 
This is a script that uses LASSO regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) to select only relevant predictors, targeting purchases by demographic.

##### Using Regression to Predict Ad Cost 
Using regression to predict advertising cost with various predictors including engagement, clicks, impressions and more.
