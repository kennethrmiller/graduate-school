### network_analysis_final
This Jupyter notebook contains network analysis of tweets surrounding three car brands: Toyota, Jeep, and Honda. I have visualized both the semantic and mention networks in Gephi and have included some personality insights to better understand the feeling for each brand on Twitter. The tweets are pulled from Twitter using their own API.

### mentionimg, semanticimg, and valueimg
These folders contain Gephi visualizations of networks shown in the main Jupyter Notebook.
